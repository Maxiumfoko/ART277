<p><b>There are many variations of passages of lorem Ispsum available, but the majority have suffered<br>
alteration in some forms, by injected humor, or <u>ramdomized words</u> which don't look even slightly <br>believable.</b> if you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything<br> embarrasing hidden in the middle of text.
<i>All the Luremus generators on the the internet tend to repeat<br> predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the internet.</i>
It uses a dictionary of over<br> 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structres, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks<br> reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always the free repetition, humour, or non-<br>characteristic words etc.</p>


<h1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h1>

<p><b>Loren Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typing industry. Loren Ipsum has been the<br> 
industry's standard  dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and<br> scrambled dummy text ever since the 1500, when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and <br> scrambled it to to make a type specimen book. it has survived. not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.  it was popularised in the 1960s with
the release of<br> Letraset sheet containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like<br> <i><b><u>AlduspageMaker</u></b></i> including version of <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> <b>1914 translation by H. Rackham</b>

          

   <blockquote>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incidiunt ut labore<br>
       et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim venam, quis nostrud exercition ullamco laboris misi<br>
       ut aliqip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse<br>

<h1>Why do we use it?</h1>

<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking
   at its<br> layout. The point of using <u>Lorem Ipsum</u> is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters,
   as oppsed to<br> using <q>Content here, content here</q>, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages
   and<br> many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> 
   sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
